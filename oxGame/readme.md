--What am l doing??
The goal of this is to create a simple two player x and naught game
Instead of creating an AI that will play against the player this will be a two player it

--how am l doing this
Making use of a multidemensional array to contain the players characters. (3 x 3);


--idea for the code...
a method that will handle the drawing of the board.
a method that will check the status of the board (win or lose)
a method that will check if the game is a draw.
a method to allow the current player to play 
 -this method will check if the the players move is valid or not (is the space taken??).
Track the turns of the game...
-it only increments after both the players play
