--What am l doing??
The goal of this is to create a simple two player x and naught game
Instead of creating an AI that will play against the player this will be a two player it

--how am l doing this
Making use of a multidemensional array to contain the players characters. (3 x 3);


--idea for the code...
a method that will handle the drawing of the board.
a method that will check the status of the board (win or lose)
a method that will check if the game is a draw.
a method to allow the current player to play 
 -this method will check if the the players move is valid or not (is the space taken??).
Track the turns of the game...
-it only increments after both the players play
create a method that is used as a tutorial this will show the users how to play the game...

--tutorial 
this will be a quick game that teaches the players how to play the game and it will be scripted.
the goal of this tutorial is to teach the user how to play the game.

the tutorial will just be until the player draws across the first row...
